🛠️ Prerequisites
Before running the Quantum Particle Lab, ensure you have:
Required:

Rust (latest stable version)

Install from rustup.rs
Verify: rust --version


Web Server (one of the following):

Python 3.x: python --version
Node.js: node --version
VS Code with Live Server extension



Recommended:

Modern Browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
VS Code for development
Git for version control

🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-particle-lab.git
cd quantum-particle-lab
2. Start the Physics Engine (Backend)
bashcd backend
cargo run
Expected Output:
🚀 Quantum Particle Lab running on ws://127.0.0.1:8080
⚠️ Keep this terminal open! The physics engine must stay running.
3. Launch the Frontend
Open a new terminal and choose one of these methods:
Option A: Python HTTP Server
bashcd frontend
python -m http.server 3000
Option B: Node.js Serve
bashcd frontend
npx serve . -p 3000
Option C: VS Code Live Server

Right-click frontend/index.html
Select "Open with Live Server"

4. Open in Browser
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000
🎮 Controls & Usage
🖱️ Mouse Controls

Move Mouse: Attract/repel particles based on force settings
Click Canvas: Create ripple effects and energy bursts
Mouse Wheel: Zoom in/out (if implemented)

⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

🎛️ Control Panel
Physics Controls

Gravitational Force: -0.5 to 1.0 - Controls downward pull
Collision Damping: 0.1 to 1.0 - Particle bounce intensity
Particle Count: 50 to 2000 - Number of active particles
Mouse Field Strength: -20 to 20 - Attraction/repulsion force

Preset Modes

🌌 Black Hole: High gravity, low bounce, strong attraction
⚡ Particle Storm: Negative gravity, maximum bounce, repulsion
🌊 Fluid Sim: Low gravity, high bounce, medium interaction
🚀 Zero-G: No gravity, perfect bounce, gentle interaction

Action Controls

🔄 Reset Simulation: Regenerate all particles with random positions
⏸ Pause: Freeze physics while keeping UI responsive

🔧 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Backend Won't Start
bash# Update Rust
rustup update

# Clean and rebuild
cd backend
cargo clean
cargo build
Frontend Connection Failed

Ensure backend is running on ws://localhost:8080
Check browser console for WebSocket errors
Try different web server (Python vs Node.js vs Live Server)

Poor Performance

Reduce Particle Count: Use slider to decrease particles
Close Other Tabs: Free up browser resources
Enable Hardware Acceleration: Check browser settings
Update Graphics Drivers: Ensure WebGL support

Canvas Not Responsive

Refresh Page: Sometimes WebSocket needs reconnection
Check Browser Console: Look for JavaScript errors
Try Different Browser: Test WebGL compatibility

🎨 Customization
Adding New Presets
Edit frontend/js/ui.js in the handlePreset() method:
javascriptconst presets = {
    yourpreset: {
        gravity: 0.15,
        bounce: 0.7,
        mouseForce: 8,
        particles: 800
    }
};
Modifying Particle Colors
Edit backend/src/main.rs in the PhysicsEngine::new() method:
rustlet colors = ["#ff6b6b", "#4ecdc4", "#45b7d1", "#96ceb4"];
Adjusting Visual Effects
Edit frontend/styles/particles.css for animations and frontend/js/physics.js for rendering.
